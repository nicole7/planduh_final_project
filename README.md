PLANDUH

Planduh is a location based intelligent recommendation app that provides users with insightful events, food options, and activities in their area based on insight derived from personality questions.




Footnote:

When starting Dev Bootcamp I worked on a PC using Linux. I obtained a Mac through another DBC student, continued my work on here but was still under his alias (Matthew-Black) when commiting for projects. Since DBC's closing, some of previous projects have been lost and I am pushing up what I have worked on both solo and paired. My final project for PlanDuh was deployed and can be viewed at: www.planduh.com.

This project was in collaboration of 5 students including myself. My contribution for this project was the recommender engine in which we used machine learning to recommend activites to users. I also created tests to ensure our API's were properly being called.
